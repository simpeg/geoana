def peak_time(z, sigma, mu=mu_0):
    r"""Compute peak time for a plane wave in a homogeneous electromagnetic media.

    For a particular distance along the propagation path of a planewave in
    a homogeneous media, the `peak time <https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/transient_planewaves_homogeneous/peaktime.html>`_
    is the time at which the maximum signal amplitude is observed. In other words,
    it is simple computation for when the peak of the planewave will arrive.

    For the quasistatic case (no electric displacement), the peak time is given by:

    .. math::
        t_{max} = \frac{\mu \sigma z^2}{6}

    where :math:`\mu` is the magnetic permeability, :math:`\sigma` is the electrical
    conductivity and *z* is the propagation distance.

    Notes
    -----
    The inputs values will be broadcasted together following normal numpy rules, and
    will support general shapes. Therefore every input, except for the `secondary` flag,
    can be arrays of the same shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : float or numpy.ndarray
        propagation distance from the planewave source (m)
    sigma : float or numpy.ndarray
        electrical conductivity (S/m)
    mu : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
        magnetic permeability (A/m). Default is the permeability of free-space
        (:math:`\mu_0`)

    Returns
    -------
    float, np.ndarray
        Peak time/times in seconds. The dimensions for return will depend on
        whether floats or arrays were used to define the propagation distance
        and physical properties of the medium.

    return (mu * sigma * z**2)/6.


def diffusion_distance(time, sigma, mu=mu_0):
    r"""Compute diffusion distance for a plane wave in a homogeneous electromagnetic media.

    For a planewave source in a homogeneous media, the `diffusion distance <https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/transient_planewaves_homogeneous/peakdistance.html>`_
    is the propagation distance the peak has travelled at a given time. It is sometimes
    referred to as the peak distance. The diffusion distance is a simple computation for
    how far a planewave has travelled after a certain time.

    For the quasistatic case (no electric displacement), the diffusion distance is given by:

    .. math::
        D = \sqrt{\frac{2 t}{\mu \sigma}}

    where :math:`\mu` is the magnetic permeability, :math:`\sigma` is the electrical
    conductivity and *t* is the time.

    Notes
    -----
    The inputs values will be broadcasted together following normal numpy rules, and
    will support general shapes. Therefore every input, except for the `secondary` flag,
    can be arrays of the same shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : float or numpy.ndarray
        propagation time (s)
    sigma : float or numpy.ndarray
        electrical conductivity (S/m)
    mu : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
        magnetic permeability (A/m). Default is the permeability of free-space
        (:math:`\mu_0`)

    Returns
    -------
    float, np.ndarray
        Diffusion distance in meters. The dimensions for return will depend on
        whether floats or arrays were used to define the propagation distance
        and physical properties of the medium.
